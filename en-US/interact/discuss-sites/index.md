You can discuss the sites with the community and us. Go to [SudoTV Discussion](https://github.com/SudoTV/sudo.tv/discussions) to talk about any topic. For sub-sites of the SudoTV Project, you can go to the discussion board for each subsite or just post it under [SudoTV Discussion](https://github.com/SudoTV/sudo.tv/discussions). Questions feedbacks are more than welcome.
